# Normalize-indices-for-water
Geochemical normalization indices with the Eh-pH behaviour of potentially hazardous elements in environmental contexts. The objective is to interpret mobility, fixation, and environmental risk based on geochemical processes, not just concentrations.
Example for potentially hazardous elements (As, Hg, Cd, Se, Li, U, P, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Sb, Cr, Co, Ca, Al, K, Mg, Tl, Al, Fe, Mn): http://weppi.gtk.fi/publ/foregsatlas/articles.php). But applicable to mineral exploration.
